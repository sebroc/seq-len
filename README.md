Tutorial on sequence-length requirement results in computational phylogenetics

Date: September 14, 2018

Format: Jupyter notebook. (NOTE: The file should be downloaded and run locally. The GitHub rendering of the TeX is not perfect.)

Description: Basic insights on data requirements in phylogenetics are derived both analytically and numerically using simple Python simulations.
